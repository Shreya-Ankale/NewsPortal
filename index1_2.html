            <p style="line-height:1.5">The Karnataka government has withdrawn its order banning photography and videography inside the government offices under the directions of Chief Minster Basavaraj Bommai.

                The government had on Friday morning issued an order prohibiting taking of photos and videos in its offices without prior permission. This followed a petition submitted to the government by the president of Karnataka State Government Employees’ Association, seeking a ban.
                
                However, following criticism, the CM examined the order and instructed that it be revoked. Accordingly, the order was withdrawn around midnight by the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms.
                
                Speaking to the media, CM Bommai clarified that the order had not come to his attention. “Government employees had been complaining about this for a while, especially since it (uploading of photos and videos) had caused problems to women employees. However, our administration is being run in a transparent manner and we have nothing to hide. We want things to continue as before without any restrictions, and therefore, I have taken the decision to rescind the order,” he said.
